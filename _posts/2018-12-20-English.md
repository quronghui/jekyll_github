## Original article

1. My life is not your porn,” read one poster. “We should be able to live, not survive,” declared another. The women brandishing them in the centre of Seoul wore red clothes and large sunglasses. They had covered their heads with baseball caps or broad-brimmed hats. The headgear and glasses serve mainly to make the protesters unrecognisable to men who might be hostile to their cause: the fight against molka, videos which are filmed using cameras hidden in public toilets, school changing rooms or even women’s homes, and then posted on the Internet.

2. + read -  read one poster.  写着，写成。
   + cover A with B.  用B遮盖A
   + caps(鸭舌帽) and hats.(优雅的帽子）
   + serve to...  产生结果
   + hostile to their cause 伤害...诉求
   + headgear  帽子

   一张海报上写道“我的人生不是你的色情片”。另一张海报则宣称“我们应该有权利生活，而不是生存”。在首尔市中心挥舞这些海报的女性穿着红色的衣服，戴着大大的墨镜。他们用棒球帽或宽檐帽遮住头部。这些帽子和墨镜的主要作用是，让可能会对抗议者的诉求产生敌意的男性认不出她们。她们的诉求是对抗 molka，也就是用隐藏式摄像机拍摄并上传到网上的影片。这些摄像机通常隐藏在公厕、学校更衣室甚至是女性住所里。

3. The red-clad women are the most visible part of a wave (后面两个介词短语进行补充具体的地点) of activismagainst sexism in South Korea, which was ranked 118th out of 144 countries last year in the World Economic Forum’s measure of equality between the sexes. 

4. + sexism  -- 歧视女性
   + activismagainst -- ism 学术性的活动；
   + activismagainst  sexism 反对针对女性的一种活动
   + red-clad  覆盖的...,穿着...
   + measure of equality ... 对...质量的测量

   在韩国这次对抗性别歧视的活动浪潮中，这些红衣女子是最引人注目的成员。去年，在世界经济论坛对两性平等程度的估算中，韩国在 144 个国家里排第 118 名。

5. In terms of appearance and behaviour, women and men are held to wildly different standards. **A YouTube star **who （修饰语）used her make-up tutorial channel to announce that she was giving up make-up to join the “corset-free” movement, which challenges unrealistic beauty standards, **received a torrent of online threats**（句子主干）.

6. + are held to ...  遵从...
   + corset-free    脱去束身衣
   + a torrent of  不断地-贬义

   就外貌和行为而言，女性和男性遵从的标准迥然不同。一位 YouTube 红人在她的化妆教程频道上宣布，她将为了加入“脱下束身衣”运动放弃化妆，而这次运动旨在挑战对美貌不切实际的标准。随后，她收到了大量来自网友的威胁。

7. “Misogyny is still common sense in South Korea,” says Yun Kim Ji-yeong of Konkuk University in Seoul. “People do not accept that women are worth the same as men.

8. + common sense  常态
   + A are worth the same as B  A等同于B

   来自首尔建国大学的尹金知英女士表示：“对女性的贬抑在韩国依然是常态。人们无法接受女性和男性有一样的价值。”

9. But women are increasingly challenging this conviction. Many are cropping their hair, crushing their eyeshadow and throwing away their lipstick—and posting videos of their rebellion online. 

   但是越来越多的韩国女性正在挑战这种根深蒂固的成见。很多女性开始剪去长发，砸烂眼影，丢掉口红，并把她们的这些反抗行为拍成视频发到网上。

   + rebellion   反抗...行为

10. Ms Yun Kim believes the individual focus of the movement is its strength. She thinks the anti-spycam protests have drawn such crowds because they speak directly to women’s daily experience. “If you cannot even be safe from intrusion in the bathroom or in your own home, then where are you safe?” She says.

   尹金女士认为，此次运动的重点是个人行为，这是它的优势所在。她认为，反偷拍抗议之所以吸引了这么多人参与，是因为这些抗议与女性日常生活中的经验有关。她说道：“如果你在洗手间和自己家里都不能免受侵扰，那到底哪里才是安全的呢？”

   + focus of  
   + anti-spycam  反偷拍抗议
   + speak to  sth 与...息息相关
   + intrusion  扰乱

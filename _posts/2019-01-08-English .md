# Taylor Swift used facial recognition software to detect stalkers at LA concert

+ 泰勒·斯威夫特在洛杉矶演唱会上用人脸识别软件侦查跟踪者
+ stalkers  跟踪者

1. The periphery of a Taylor Swift concert is as thought out as the show she presents on stage. Beyond the traditional merchandise stands, there are often dedicated selfie-staging points and staff distributing light-up bracelets. When Swift performed at the Los Angeles Rose Bowl venue, fans could watch rehearsal clips at a special kiosk.泰勒·斯威夫特音乐会的周边区域就像她在舞台上的表演一样，是经过深思熟虑的。除了销售周边商品的摊位，通常还安排了专门的自拍点，以及发荧光手环的工作人员。当斯威夫特在洛杉矶玫瑰碗的演出现场表演时，歌迷们可以在一个特别的亭子里观看其排练片段。
   + thought out  考虑的

2. What they didn’t know was that a facial recognition camera inside the structure was taking their photographs and cross-referencingthe images with a database held in Nashville of hundreds of Swift’s known stalkers, according to a Rolling Stone report.但他们所不知道的是，那里有一架人脸识别摄像头在拍照，并将他们的照片与位于纳什维尔的数据库进行交叉对照，此数据库中有数百个斯威夫特的跟踪者（的面部图像），以上信息由《滚石》杂志报道。

3. While some have raised privacy concerns over the ownership and storage of the images, concerts are technically private events, and Swift has no obligation to notify ticket holders that they may be surveilled. The Guardian has contacted Swift’s representatives for comment.虽然有些人对这些图像的所有权及存储提出了有关个人隐私的担忧，但音乐会严格意义上来说是私人活动，斯威夫特没有义务告知持票人他们可能会受到监视。卫报已经联系了斯威夫特的代表人进行评论。

4. Swift has a number of known stalkers. In September, she got a restraining order against Eric Swarbrick, who had been harassing her with letters threatening rape and murder since September 2016. Also in May, Mohammed Jaffar was sentenced to six months in jail and five years’ probation having been convictedfor burglary after he appeared at Swift’s New York home five times in two months.斯威夫特有许多众所周知的跟踪者。去年 9 月，她申请到了针对埃里克·斯瓦布里克的限制令。自 2016 年 9 月以来，他一直用威胁强奸和谋杀的信件骚扰她。另外在去年 5 月，默罕默德·加法尔因在两个月内五次出现在斯威夫特在纽约的家中而被判入室盗窃罪，将入狱 6 个月，缓刑期 5 年。

5. The use of facial recognition software is rising at public events. In April, Chinese police used the technology to arrest a man attending a Jacky Cheung concert in Nanchang. The 31-year-old, who was wanted for “economic crimes”, was located among a crowd of 60,000 concert goers.公共场合人脸识别软件的使用正呈上升趋势。去年 4 月，中国警方利用该技术逮捕了一名在南昌参加张学友演唱会的男子。今年 31 岁的他因“经济犯罪”而被通缉，他当时混在 6 万个演唱会观众之中。

6. A recent UN report criticised the use of facial recognition by police in south Wales during a peaceful demonstration as disproportionate and unnecessary.（不过，）联合国最近的一份报告指责了南威尔士警察在和平示威中使用面部识别技术的做法，并认为这是不适当且不必要的。

# ‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse’: A Fresh Take on a Venerable Hero

《蜘蛛侠：平行宇宙》：一位可敬英雄的崭新形象

+ A Fresh Take on  一个全新角度
+ take n 看法

1. “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” contains a vital element that has been missing from too many recent superhero movies: fun. This animated reworking of the Spidey mythos（神话）--主语 is fresh and exhilarating in a way that very few of its live-action counterparts — including the last couple of “Spider-Man” chapters — have been. Its jaunty, brightly colored inventiveness and its kid-in-the-candy-store appetite for pop culture ephemera give “Into the Spider-Verse” some of the kick of the first “Lego Movie.”  《蜘蛛侠：平行宇宙》包含一种不可或缺的要素，最近有太多超级英雄电影都缺了它：趣味。 这部蜘蛛侠的动画改编版令人耳目一新又倍感兴奋 ，这是它的同名真人实景电影未能做到的，该系列中最近的几部作品也不例外。它具有轻松活泼，色彩明快的创新精神，对流行文化中昙花一现的事物有着热切的渴望，仿佛置身糖果店的孩子一般。正因如此，《蜘蛛侠：平行宇宙》才有了第一部《乐高大电影》那样的刺激。

2. And, as I was saying, a lot of fun. The story is clever and just complicated enough, moving quickly through silly bits, pausing for moments of heart-tugging sentiment, and losing itself in wild creative mischief. It is referential (and reverential) enough to Marvel traditions to please the geek armies, and perfectly accessible to new recruits or part-time warriors.以及，如我刚才所说，非常有趣。故事情节巧妙又复杂得恰到好处，时而在傻气的片段中快速推进，时而在揪心的感伤时刻停顿，时而沉浸在不按常理出牌的，创造性的搞怪中。它和漫威传统风格建立的联结，以及对其展现的敬意，足以取悦死忠粉大军。同时它对新入坑的观众和休闲影迷也足够友好。

3. It finds realism, too. This may be the first “Spider-Man” feature to qualify as a great New York movie, drawn from the life of the city rather than outdated stereotypes. Streets and subways, apartments and schoolyards are beautifully and faithfully drawn, as are humans of all ages, shapes and hues. The people talk fast, the music is loud and sometimes hectic, and everyone is in motion all the time. Even the tourists from other universes are sorry to leave.它又很真实。该作可能是“蜘蛛侠”正片中第一部算得上十足的纽约电影的。电影取材于城市的生活而不是过时的刻板印象。街道和地铁，公寓和校园都刻画得美观而忠实，年龄、体型、肤色各不相同的人物也是如此。人们说话语速很快，音乐声响亮，有时甚至紧张匆忙，每个人都在不停地移动。甚至来自其他宇宙的旅客都不舍得离开这里。
